## What does it do?
The chrome extension displays the likes and dislikes on a youtube video without the requirement of the user opening it. This saves the users' time since it allows them to quickly judge if a video is good or not by simply viewing its like and dislike count. The extension also calculates the percentage of likes out of the total responses. A like percentage greater than 98 is highlighted in green and labeled "Recommended", a like percentage of less than 40 is highlighted in red and a video with not responses is marked in grey, along with their like and dislike counts. Rest of the videos simply display their like and dislike counts.
